# SFO-project
Sharpbelly Fish Optimizer (SFO) is a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm proposed in our 2024 paper. Inspired by the ecological behaviors of Hemiculter leucisculus, SFO integrates four adaptive strategies—fast swimming, swarm gathering, stagnation-triggered dispersal, and escape under disturbance—to balance exploration and exploitation. The algorithm has demonstrated strong performance on CEC2022 benchmark functions and three classical engineering design problems, showing high robustness and competitiveness against PSO, ACO, GWO, SSA, and other state-of-the-art optimizers. This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of SFO for academic and research use.
